\title{
A novel test of independence
}
\description{
This function implements a novel test of independence of bivariate data. It is based on the formula of the exact distribution of the ith 
nearest neighbour given the previous nearest neighbour (see \code{\link{Pc_givena}}). 
}
\usage{
novelTest.extreme(xdata, ydata, maxi = length(xdata) - 1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{xdata}{
first dimension of data
}
  \item{ydata}{
second dimension of data
}
  \item{maxi}{
	up to which ith nearest neighbour to consider 
}
