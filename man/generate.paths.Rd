\title{
Generate all nearest neighbours distances for one point in a sample
}
\description{
Help function which generates the nearest neighbhour distances for a single point in a sample, assuming rank data on a torus with the maximum distance.
}
\usage{
generate.paths(index, rx, ry, N)
}
\arguments{
  \item{index}{
    for which point to calculate the nearest neighbhour distances
}
  \item{rx}{
    ranked data (1st dimension)
}
  \item{ry}{
    ranked data (2nd dimension)
}
  \item{N}{
    Number of points in sample
}
}
\value{
    a vector of length (N-1) containing the sorted distances to the nearest neighbour of point index in the sample
}
